# unix_location
This is the project that transfers user's location and health information from Bluetooth to server 


Simply running "make" in root socket folder and  it will build your own firmware.

It will create necessary folders automatically and build itself

Run ./socket to test this function

To build your own firmware you need to have access to a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system
(case-sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin will not be supported because of
the lack of case sensitiveness in the file system.
